Custom resources are extensions of the Kubernetes API.
Once a custom resource is installed, users can create and access its objects using kubectl, just as they do for built-in resources like Pods.

Adding custom resources
Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to your cluster:

1. CRDs are simple and can be created without any programming.
2. API Aggregation requires programming, but allows more control over API behaviors like how data is stored and conversion between API versions.
CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server. You do not need to understand API Aggregation to use CRDs.

To fully manage the lifecycle of these custom resources, you might want to create a custom controller or operator.
